Title of the Project => Rent Motorcycles
Overiew => Ability to create an account of your own. Create a post to rent your bike and post. Rent bikes and see bikes you rented before and write and see the comments on the bikes.


User Story=>
When I go to the webpage, I can see the rental bikes. To rent I need to signin or signup. I can go to rental bikes page and see its features such as their model, make, price, year, comments and availability. I can save a bike for later or I can rent it right on the page. I can go to the my rental bikes page where I can see the bikes I rented with the dates(strech goal). I can sign out.
